Came across a great set of resources I stumbled over via Hacker News. Just looked over it with a first glance, but initial thoughts are that the set of people (apart from Simon Willison and Andrej Karpathy) might be the most valuable tip.

Ironically, one of the tips from Atharva is to "stay as close to the source as possible", and here I am taking his list of sources and recommendations and not building it for myself. However, I'll need to take another pass at the list and work through which ones I like and don't like.
