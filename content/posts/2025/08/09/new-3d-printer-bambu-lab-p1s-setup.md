Had considered buying a 3D printer for quite some time and now finally did.

After much research, settled on a Bambu Lab P1S (combo unit with an AMS, Automatic Material System) since it has great reviews, would be simple to use and setup, and be extensible if I decide to start printing in other materials than regular PLA.

Ordered directly from Bambu Labs and got delivery in 3 days!

Setup was simple to do, I followed the official video found here: [https://youtu.be/1Thb5LgGxUM](https://youtu.be/1Thb5LgGxUM)

Once that was done, I printed a small Benchy (a little boat) which seems to be the way most people do a test print as their first one. Used this model: [https://makerworld.com/en/models/40146-benchy-bambu-pla-basic](https://makerworld.com/en/models/40146-benchy-bambu-pla-basic?from=search#profileId-109644)

It printed great!
