I've now had the printer for about 18 hours and I've printed 3 things so far, apart from the first Benchy boat.

**Bed Scraper**

The first print was a Bed Scraper since I wanted a tool to help me get print and calibration strips off the bed easier.
I used this model: [Bed Scraper XL](https://makerworld.com/en/models/413220-bed-scraper-xl?from=search#profileId-374905)

An advantage of this scraper is the detachable blades. Makes it really easy to print more of them as they wear out. Nor sure how often that will be, but it felt unnecessary to not have the option. It also has a few accessories that I might consider printing later.

**Knitting needle holder**

Printed this holder for my fianc√©es knitting needles: [https://www.printables.com/model/228485-knitting-needle-storage-clip](https://www.printables.com/model/228485-knitting-needle-storage-clip)

Used the 4mm version for the first one to see how it came out. It was a perfect fit for the needles as far as I can tell. Will see how much it is used.

**Golf Green Divot Tool**

A small tool used to fix divots in golf greens made by the ball impact. Used this model: [https://www.printables.com/model/111155-golf-divot-tool](https://www.printables.com/model/111155-golf-divot-tool)

Also tried Ironing for the first time with this one. Did not work as expected since the top surface of the tool is not flat. Each layer turned out great, but layer lines are still very visible on the top. Will need to do some research to see if it's possible to smooth those out completely on angled surfaces.
