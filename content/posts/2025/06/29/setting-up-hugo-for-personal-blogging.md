I decided I wanted something different than MkDocs to run my blog, mainly because I did not like the look of the theme I was using with MkDocs, but I also wanted a proper CMS so that I didn't have to worry about placing and naming files correctly myself.

Below is a breakdown of the process.

## Selecting a new engine

## Converting from old to new setup

### Installing Hugo & PaperMod

### Installing Decap CMS and Authenticating

## Issues along the way

- Setting up GitHub App instead of OAuth App for better scoping of permissions
- Posts not being built properly (slug/path mismatch?)
