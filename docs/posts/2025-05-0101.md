# Blogging with MkDocs

I've been looking for a good tool to setup a personal blog. MkDocs might be a good one so I decided to test it.

<!-- end-excerpt -->

I wanted a way to work with a local tool so that I can use AI-tools to help me with tagging and similar things. I also wanted to be able to deploy it online simply so GitHub Pages seemed like a good option, which MkDocs supports.

## Setting up `mkdocs`

The first step was to setup the project by running this:

```zsh
# Setup the directory for the repo
mkdir personal-blog
cd personal-blog

# Setup a UV project
uv init

# Activate the venv before installing dependencies
source .venv/bin/activate

# install mkdocs and the theme material in one go
uv add mkdocs-material
```

## Configuring mkdocs

In order to make the blog look the way I wanted it to, there was quite a bit of config to be done.

### Configuring mkdocs for blogging

First of all, the config file needs to be created:

```zsh
touch mkdocs.yml
```

Once that is created, the blog plugin needs to be enabled, together with some additional config:

```yaml
theme:
  name: material # Enable the mkdocs-material theme
  features:
    - navigation.path
    - navigation.prune

plugins:
  - blog:
    blog_dir: . # This is necessary since I'm only blogging, not building documentation as well
```

### Additional configuration

#### Categories

IN order to make sure that I am consistent with my categories, only specific ones should be allowed. This is set in the `mkdocs.yml` config file as well:

```yaml
plugins:
  - blog:
      ... # Other config
      categories_allowed:
        - blogging
        - projects
```

### Full config file

This is the full config file contents:

```yaml
site_name: Personal blog
site_description: My personal blog to keep track of my thoughts and ideas.
site_url: https://www.example.com

theme:
  name: material
  features:
    - navigation.path
    - navigation.prune

markdown_extensions:
  - def_list
  - pymdownx.tasklist:
      custom_checkbox: true
  - pymdownx.highlight:
      use_pygments: true
      auto_title: true
      linenums_style: pymdownx-inline
      anchor_linenums: true
      line_spans: __span
      pygments_lang_class: true
  - pymdownx.inlinehilite
  - pymdownx.snippets
  - pymdownx.superfences
  - pymdownx.betterem

plugins:
  - search
  - blog:
      blog_dir: .
      categories_allowed:
        - blogging
        - projects
      post_date_format: long
      post_excerpt_separator: <!-- end-excerpt -->
      archive_url_date_format: yyyy/MM
  - meta
  - tags
```

## Working locally

In order to see posts and navigating the site locally, the server needs to be started:

```zsh
mkdocs serve
```

## Publishing the blog

The blog is currently hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) under the URL [https://cstalhem.github.io](https://cstalhem.github.io). This is the process to set that up:

1. Create a new public repository on GitHub
   1. This needs to be called [username].github.io
2. Link the local project to the repo
3. Set up GitHub Actions
4. Push the code!
